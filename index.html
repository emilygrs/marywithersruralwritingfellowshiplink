  <li> <a href="https://www.nycitynewsservice.com/2021/12/roosevelt-island-wants-a-new-bank-where-there-is-none/"> Roosevelt Island Wants A New Bank Where There Is None</a> is an investigative piece I wrote on the community of Roosevelt Island, an island between Manhattan and Queens. Roosevelt Island is a part of New York City's Community District 8, which is the beat I was assigned for Fall 2021 semester. It is an underrepresented community, due to it being separated from the rest of the boroughts of NYC. It is only accesible by subway, TRAM or the NYC Ferry, and by car minimally to Queens. Many folks just take the subway or TRAM as it is the easiest way to get to the other boroughs. Roosevelt Island has no current physical bank branch which is a problem for many residents, as their previous bank, Amalgamated Bank shut down in July 2020. I was able to uncover a lot from the experience of reporting this out over a month's time, interviewing a variety of sources, both bottom up and top down. </li>

It was so enlightening to hear their stories and how the business came to be, as one of the sisters, Margaret, is battling cancer.  </li>

I was amazed that there was so much effort on the ground from all the staff and the owner to help during the pandemic. They could have just thrown in the towel, but they persevered.  </li>
